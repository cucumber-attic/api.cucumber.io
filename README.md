# api.cucumber.io

This repo was created to store and publish generated API docs for Cucumber implementations.

API docs tend to be big, and there are many versions. Keeping them in a separate repo means not bloating the main docs repo.

For now, it should include generated docs per release (even though it could be useful to be able to refer to master branch docs also).

The site is (currently) live at: https://hunter-ethel-13616.netlify.com/README.md
