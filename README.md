# api.cucumber.io

This repo was created to store and publish generated API docs for Cucumber implementations.

API docs tend to be big, and with many versions it will be huge. By keeping them in a separate repo we don't have to bloat the main docs repo.

For now, it should include generated docs per release (even though it could be useful to be able to refer to master branch docs too).

The site is (currently) live at: https://hunter-ethel-13616.netlify.com/README.md
